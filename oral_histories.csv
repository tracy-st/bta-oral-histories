Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007).",https://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/U-0020/menu.html,1930s-1980s,2005,"Willie Mae Lee Crews was born into a sharecropping family in Marion, Alabama, during the 1930s. She describes her childhood as impoverished, but stresses that she was instilled with a strong work ethic by her close-knit family. During the 1950s, Crews attended Dillard University in New Orleans on scholarship and then continued her education at the graduate level at Fisk University in Nashville. As a graduate student in sociology, Crews was sent to Montgomery, Alabama, to interview participants in the bus boycott. By the early 1960s, Crews had become a teacher. She describes her work at Hayes High School, an African American school in Birmingham, during the 1960s and 1970s. Crews first started teaching at Hayes in 1963; she describes it as an excellent segregated school with strong leadership and high standards for its students. Crews was still teaching at Hayes in 1970-1971 when Birmingham schools were desegregated. Here, she focuses more on efforts to integrate faculty rather than on efforts to integrate students. She describes how the school district transferred teachers in a way that favored white teachers and schools to the detriment of students at schools like Hayes. Crews also discusses the role of segregated housing in creating what she calls a ""projects mentality."" Social trends such as this, along with ineffective policies and the influx of poorly trained teachers, were to blame for the deterioration of integrated schools. In particular, she laments the disappearance of teaching philosophies that had stressed teaching students integrity, social responsibility, and self-confidence that had characterized Hayes High School prior to desegregation."

His advocacy began at age thirteen, when he joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). During the late 1930s, he attended Howard High School, the state’s only high school for African Americans. Upon graduation, he spent two years at West Chester University of Pennsylvania on a track scholarship before joining the Tuskegee Airmen during War World II. While he was there, he witnessed the building of the airfield at Tuskegee in 1941. He taught future pilots the art of instrument flying. His duties sent him to the Link Trainer Facilities and Schools in New York, and Chanute Field in Chanute, Illinois, as well as the Base Instrument Command Flying School in Texas. In February 1946, he was discharged from the U.S. Army. Encouraged by his fellow Tuskegee Airmen, Mitchell returned to college, and earned his degree from West Chester University of Pennsylvania and began a career in the psychiatric treatment of children and civil rights advocacy.
Mitchell led the Delaware State Branches of the NAACP as president for over thirty years until 1991. During his years there, he led their efforts to secure fair housing, equal access to public accommodations, and equal education and employment opportunities for Delaware’s African American community. He became the first African American teacher of white children at Governor Bacon Health Center in Delaware City. He retired from teaching in 1984. His wife, Jane Mitchell, now deceased, became one of Delaware’s first African American nurses. For many years, she served as the director of nursing at the Delaware State Hospital and along with her husband led efforts to desegregate the state’s hospitals.

In 1940, Nelson returned to Howard to serve as dean and became vice president in 1961. While at Howard he started the Journal of Religious Thought and retired in 1968.

Nelson begins the interview by describing a recent trip to Africa and his discussion with an African political leader of Southern Rhodesia, [Sitole], regarding the nonviolence philosophy. Nelson furthers the discussion by providing his opinion on the strategy of nonviolence being used within the civil rights movement. African American history and the African American history movement are also discussed in terms of a social context. Nelson and Warren then revisit the influence of slavery on identity, discussing the white Southerner and his struggle to defend his identity within his culture. Nelson discusses the influence his travels had on his writings and his thesis expressing his opinion that is necessary for African Americans to view their problems in a world context. Nelson restates his interest in the philosophy of nonviolence and describes his participation in the nonviolent March on Washington in 1941. The interview concludes with a brief discussion of the effects of the civil rights movement on the youth who are devoted to it and Nelson's observations on the division in civil rights leadership."

Over several sessions conducted via Zoom in the spring of 2021, MacArthur speaks candidly with Judy, his first New York friend, about the lessons they've learned and the era that shaped an entire generation of artists.

Her 30-year career with the Detroit Public Schools was devoted to teaching multicultural studies from an African-centered perspective, and she did much to bring about an awareness of the contributions of African Americans to the growth and development of this country. She was quoted as saying she was pleased by the progress African-American studies had made in the schools since the days when pictures of black faces or the contributions of African Americans didn’t appear in school textbooks.

Blackwell, a native of Detroit, began her career in 1955 as a teacher at Garfield Elementary School in Detroit. She served in a variety of capacities in the field of ethnic heritage and black studies including as the African/African-American studies instructional specialist in the Department of Social Studies for the school system. She also represented Region Five on Wayne State University’s Training Institute for Desegregated Education and wrote many papers on African/African-American studies curricula for grades K-12. The Detroit Board of Education recognized her outstanding contributions to education by naming one of its schools the Catherine C. Blackwell Institute of International Studies, Commerce, and Technology.

Blackwell’s love of Africa took her to that continent more than 50 times, and led her to study at most of the universities of East and West Africa. A woman of wit, compassion, and telling insight, Blackwell was a sought-after speaker, storyteller, consultant, and lecturer. Her devotion to education and multicultural studies earned her accolades and honors by the score while her warmth and generosity made her a much-loved member of the community."
